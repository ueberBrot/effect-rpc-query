description: Run the repository's React Query and TanStack Start applications.
---

The repository contains two complete applications. Both use the same contracts and Effect RPC
handler implementation, but each hosts HTTP differently. Both RPC endpoints accept request bodies
up to 1 MiB and return HTTP 413 for larger bodies.

| Example                                                                                           | Demonstrates                                                                                         | RPC host                                          | Application URL         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| [Vite React](https://github.com/ueberBrot/effect-rpc-query/tree/main/examples/vite-react)         | Ordinary, infinite, accumulated-stream, live, and mutation hooks with failures and cancellation      | Standalone server on port `3001`, proxied by Vite | `http://127.0.0.1:5173` |
| [TanStack Start](https://github.com/ueberBrot/effect-rpc-query/tree/main/examples/tanstack-start) | The same operation kinds in loaders, server rendering, dehydration, hydration, and client navigation | Same-origin `POST /rpc` server route              | `http://127.0.0.1:3000` |

## Run Vite React

```sh
vp run vite-react-dev
```

This task starts both the standalone RPC server and the Vite development server.

## Run TanStack Start

```sh
vp run tanstack-start-dev
```

This task starts one full-stack process. The browser and server-rendering client both call the
Start-owned `/rpc` route.

Server rendering uses `http://127.0.0.1:3000/rpc`. If the Start server listens elsewhere, set the
server-only `EXAMPLE_RPC_ORIGIN` environment variable to its HTTP(S) origin, without a path,
credentials, query, or fragment. The browser uses the relative `/rpc` endpoint.

## Pause a query until a user is selected

In either application, find **Choose before fetching**. With **No user selected**, the generated
query uses `{ input: skipToken }` and sends no lookup request. Select **User 2: Edsger Dijkstra** to
load the user summary, then clear and reselect it within 30 seconds to reuse the cached result.

Both branches preserve the same `select` and `staleTime` options. The example uses ordinary
`useQuery`; the TanStack Start loader leaves this interactive query paused during server rendering.

## Compare full and bounded stream history

In either application, let the diagnostic stream finish, then choose **Replay newest 2**.
The accumulated history retains only “Workspace synchronized” and “Ready”; earlier updates disappear
as new ones arrive. Choose **Replay full history** to retain all four states again. The live query
continues to show only “Ready”.

The bounded replay supplies `maxChunks: 2` to `streamedOptions`. Both controls reuse the generated
streamed key: the bound changes retention policy, not RPC identity. The application keeps the selected
policy for subsequent refetches. TanStack Start also demonstrates this after hydrating its server snapshot.

## Inspect request-local metadata

In either application's diagnostics panel, choose **Trigger declared failure**. Its generated
mutation options supply the `x-request-source: diagnostics-panel` RPC header. Application-wide
authorization still comes from the shared client runner. The same `rpcOptions` input works with
queries, infinite queries, and both stream builders; see
[Generated Builders](../reference/generated-builders/#request-local-rpc-options).

## Build the examples

Build either application without starting it:

```sh
vp run vite-react-build
vp run tanstack-start-build
```

## Browser playground status

The examples do not currently run in StackBlitz WebContainers. Vite+ requires a native binding
that is unavailable there. [Issue #33](https://github.com/ueberBrot/effect-rpc-query/issues/33)
records the decision, and the
[minimal reproduction](https://github.com/ueberBrot/vite-plus-webcontainer-repro) tracks the
upstream limitation. Run either example locally or in the Dev Container.
