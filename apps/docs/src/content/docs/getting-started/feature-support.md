`effect-rpc-query` turns unary and streaming Effect RPC definitions into semantic keys and TanStack
Query Core options. Applications continue to configure TanStack Query and manage the RPC client.

Use these status values to read the matrix:

- **Generated**: the package creates the key, function, or option object.
- **Tested**: repository fixtures or executable applications verify that generated output works
  with the listed native TanStack API.
- **Application-owned**: use the upstream Effect, TanStack, or framework API directly.
- **Impossible**: the upstream TanStack contract provides no seam for this capability.
- **Deferred**: the package may add or certify this capability after `0.1.0`.

## Capability matrix

| Capability                                              | Status            | Boundary                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unary RPC queries                                       | Generated         | Each unary leaf builds `queryOptions` and semantic `queryKey` values with inferred input, data, and failure types.                                      |
| Infinite queries                                        | Generated         | Each unary leaf builds `infiniteOptions` and `infiniteKey` values with inferred page parameters, payloads, data, selected data, and failures.           |
| Unary RPC mutations                                     | Generated         | Each unary leaf builds `mutationOptions` and a stable `mutationKey`; variables remain inferred at execution.                                            |
| Accumulated streamed queries                            | Generated         | Each streaming leaf builds `streamedOptions` and `streamedKey`; values accumulate in emission order.                                                    |
| Live queries                                            | Generated         | Each streaming leaf builds `liveOptions` and `liveKey`; every value replaces the previous cached value.                                                 |
| Hierarchical cache keys                                 | Generated         | Root, branch, RPC, query, infinite, streamed, live, and mutation keys support native array-prefix matching without collisions.                          |
| Conditional queries                                     | Generated         | Payload-bearing ordinary, infinite, accumulated-stream, and live builders accept TanStack's exact `skipToken` value.                                    |
| Query cancellation                                      | Generated         | Every query function forwards TanStack's `AbortSignal`; stream cancellation also closes the iterator and its Effect resources.                          |
| Query policies, transformations, and stream refetching  | Tested            | Applicable Query Core options pass through. Accumulated streams support `reset`, `append`, and `replace` refetch modes.                                 |
| Mutation callbacks                                      | Tested            | Applicable mutation options pass through. Build native optimistic updates with the application's `QueryClient`.                                         |
| Cache reads, writes, prefetching, invalidation, and SSR | Tested            | Native `QueryClient` methods accept generated options and keys. Completed data dehydrates normally; open server streams use a cancelled first snapshot. |
| React Query                                             | Tested            | Generated options work with ordinary, infinite, suspense, prefetch, mutation, accumulated-stream, and live hooks.                                       |
| TanStack Router and Start                               | Tested            | Packed fixtures and the executable Start application cover loaders, server rendering, hydration, streams, and client navigation.                        |
| RPC transport, middleware, and client lifecycle         | Application-owned | Supply a ready flat RPC client and keep its `Scope` alive. The package does not construct a transport or add interceptors.                              |
| Providers, Devtools, persistence, broadcast, and policy | Application-owned | Configure these through TanStack Query. The package provides no wrapper or default policy.                                                              |
| Query-versus-mutation classification                    | Application-owned | Every unary leaf offers both builders because Effect RPC definitions do not label reads and writes.                                                     |
| Automatic invalidation                                  | Application-owned | Invalidate with generated prefix keys in application callbacks.                                                                                         |
| Direct RPC execution                                    | Application-owned | Call the ready RPC client directly; generated leaves remain limited to TanStack key and option builders.                                                |
| SSR error and Effect Cause serialization                | Application-owned | Failed queries are omitted from example dehydration and refetched in the browser. Applications choose any cross-realm error format.                     |
| Mutation cancellation                                   | Impossible        | TanStack mutation functions provide no query-style abort signal.                                                                                        |
| Asynchronous or Effect-returning key encoders           | Impossible        | TanStack requires cache identity synchronously when options are built.                                                                                  |
| Non-React framework certification                       | Deferred          | The package remains framework-neutral, but the repository certifies React Query only for `0.1.0`.                                                       |

## Design influences

The API design draws on these projects:

- [tRPC's TanStack React Query integration](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/tree/main/packages/tanstack-react-query)
  derives TanStack-native option builders from a typed RPC surface.
- [Effect Query](https://github.com/voidhashcom/effect-query) runs Effect programs through TanStack
  Query and demonstrates Effect RPC integration.

This package builds directly on [Effect](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect) RPC definitions and
[TanStack Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query). Its focused contract adds an eager RPC utility
tree, Schema-derived semantic keys, caller-owned RPC clients, and complete Effect Cause preservation.
