title: Query and Mutation Operations
description: Choose the generated operation that matches your RPC use.
---

Every unary RPC leaf exposes query, infinite-query, and mutation builders. The RPC definition does
not decide how the application uses the operation.

Use a query when TanStack should cache a result by semantic request identity. Payload-bearing query
keys contain the normalized, canonical payload, and TanStack can refetch or cancel the query.

Use a mutation when the call represents an action or write. Mutation variables arrive when the
mutation runs, and their values do not become part of the mutation key.

Use an infinite query when TanStack should accumulate paginated unary RPC results. Map each page
parameter to a payload; the mapped initial page becomes part of the semantic key.

Use an accumulated streamed query when the application needs every emitted value in order. Use a
live query when it needs only the latest emitted value. Both operations close their stream iterator
when TanStack cancels the query.

```ts
const user = useQuery(rpcQuery.users.get.queryOptions({ input: { id: 1 } }))

const removeUser = useMutation(rpcQuery.users.delete.mutationOptions())
removeUser.mutate({ id: 1 })
```

After a successful mutation, invalidate the affected query prefix explicitly. The package does not
infer relationships between RPCs.
