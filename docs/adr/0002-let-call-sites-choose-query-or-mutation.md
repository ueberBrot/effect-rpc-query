# Let call sites choose query or mutation

Status: Amended by ADR 0018 and ADR 0020.

## Context

Effect RPC contracts do not classify operations as reads or writes. Requiring that classification
here would duplicate the contract.

## Decision

Every unary RPC leaf exposes `queryOptions` and `mutationOptions`. The call site chooses the TanStack
semantics. Leaves expose no direct execution helper.

## Consequences

An optional branded classification may be added later without restricting the base utility tree.
ADR 0018 adds infinite queries to unary leaves. ADR 0020 supersedes this decision's omission of
streaming leaves.
