## Host Effect RPC in Start

Create an exact server route and pass its Web `Request` to a long-lived Effect RPC handler:

```ts
export const Route = createFileRoute('/rpc')({
  server: {
    handlers: {
      POST: ({ request }) => handleRpcRequest(request),
    },
  },
})
```

Effect's request/response RPC transport sends every query and mutation to this POST endpoint. It
does not map queries to GET requests or encode procedure names in the URL. Build the handler once
for the Start server's lifetime so RPC state and acquired resources survive individual requests.

Configure a trusted RPC origin for server rendering. In the executable example, set the server-only
`EXAMPLE_RPC_ORIGIN` environment variable; it defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Use the relative
`/rpc` endpoint for browser calls.

## Share utilities through the router context

Put the application-owned `QueryClient` and RPC utility tree in the router context. A route loader
can then fill the cache used by its component:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
  loader: async ({ context }) => {
    await context.queryClient.ensureQueryData(context.rpcQuery.users.list.queryOptions())
  },
  component: UsersRoute,
})

function UsersRoute() {
  const { rpcQuery } = Route.useRouteContext()
  const users = useSuspenseQuery(rpcQuery.users.list.queryOptions())
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(users.data, null, 2)}</pre>
}
```

## Preserve application lifetimes

Create a fresh application boundary per page request. Dehydrate that request's Query Client, send
its state to the browser, and hydrate a browser-owned Query Client. Reusing the same generated
options preserves cache identity because the keys depend on the key prefix, RPC tag, operation, and
canonical payload.

`effect-rpc-query` does not create the router, providers, request context, or hydration boundary.
The executable [TanStack Start example](https://github.com/ueberBrot/effect-rpc-query/tree/main/examples/tanstack-start)
shows the complete integration, including handler cleanup for server-route requests and hot module
replacement.

## Dehydrate an open stream

Completed query data, including a completed stream's cached value, uses TanStack's normal
dehydration contract. An open stream remains in `fetchStatus: 'fetching'`, so a server loader must
capture a successful snapshot and cancel the query before dehydration can finish:

```ts
const fetchStreamSnapshot = async (queryClient, options) => {
  let stopWatching = () => {}
  const snapshotReady = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const inspect = () => {
      const state = queryClient.getQueryState(options.queryKey)
      if (state?.status === 'success') resolve()
      if (state?.status === 'error') reject(state.error)
    }
    stopWatching = queryClient.getQueryCache().subscribe(inspect)
    inspect()
  })
  const fetching = queryClient.fetchQuery(options)

  try {
    await snapshotReady
    await queryClient.cancelQueries({ exact: true, queryKey: options.queryKey })
    return await fetching
  } catch (error) {
    await fetching.catch(() => undefined)
    throw error
  } finally {
    stopWatching()
  }
}
```

Cancellation closes the stream iterator and its Effect resources. The browser hydrates the server
snapshot, then may refetch according to ordinary TanStack policies.
