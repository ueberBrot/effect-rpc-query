# Host Effect RPC inside TanStack Start

Status: Accepted. Supersedes part of ADR 0013.

Start hosts the standard Effect RPC HTTP protocol at its own exact `POST /rpc` route to demonstrate
the full-stack integration. A host-neutral Web handler shares the implementation with the
standalone Node server, which continues to serve Vite React. The examples exercise separate
hosting adapters; ADR 0013's shared-host requirement no longer applies.
