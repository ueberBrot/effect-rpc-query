title: RPC Utility Tree
description: Understand how RPC tags become nested query utilities.

`createRpcQueryUtils` eagerly projects dotted unary and streaming RPC tags into one frozen RPC
utility tree:

| RPC tag                    | Generated path                            |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `users.get`                | `rpcQuery.users.get`                      |
| `projects.by-id.find`      | `rpcQuery.projects['by-id'].find`         |
| `billing-history.list all` | `rpcQuery['billing-history']['list all']` |

Each branch has `key()`. Unary leaves add ordinary query, infinite-query, and mutation builders.
Streaming leaves add accumulated-stream and live-query builders. The tree is built once, so invalid
tags, collisions, and encoder configuration fail during factory construction.

Reserved builder names cannot appear where they would collide with generated members. See
[Generated Builders](/effect-rpc-query/reference/generated-builders/) for the leaf interface.
